# Study Cards Spring Boot Project

This is my simple Spring Boot project for managing study cards. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete study cards through a RESTful API.
For practice purposes, I am using docker to work with the postgres database.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL (or a compatible database)

## API Endpoints

The project provides the following API endpoints for managing study cards:

- `GET /api/v1/studycards`: Retrieve a list of all study cards.
- `POST /api/v1/studycards`: Create a new study card.
- `PUT /api/v1/studycards/{studyCardId}`: Update an existing study card by ID.
- `DELETE /api/v1/studycards/{studyCardId}`: Delete a study card by ID.

## Example Usage

Assuming the application is running locally on port 8080:

- Retrieve all study cards: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/studycards`
- Create a new study card: `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/studycards`
  Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Java Basics",
    "description": "Learn the fundamentals of Java programming."
  }
